# ☺️ Mood Monitor - Backend

Mood Monitor is a React app that allows mindful users to track their mood daily, or throughout the day 🗓️ .

Add a new date, and for each day add as much mood tracking as you like. Each mood check-in is time stamped, and has a Like button to keep track of check-ins you would like to pay special attention to 🗒️.

# 🏁 Before you begin:

* Check your Ruby version (ruby -v this project uses ruby '2.6.1', use rbenv to get to the correct version)
* Make sure you have the latest version of Rails installed
